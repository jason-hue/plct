# Licheepi4A Native games Supertuxkart Test Documentation

 

Download command:

```bash
sudo apt install supertuxkart
```

Run the command:

```bash
supertuxkart
```

After the game starts, it is very laggy. The CPU single core is heavily loaded. The overall load is 120%. When I check the CPU utilization using top, a random core load is 100%, but the utilization of the other cores is low. The game is very laggy and unplayable.

This should be the lowest quality, it's still very laggy, it takes 20 seconds to respond after clickingï¼š
